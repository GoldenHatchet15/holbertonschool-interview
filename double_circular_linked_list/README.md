# Add Nodes

This repository contains an implementation of a double circular linked list in C. The primary focus is on adding nodes to the list while maintaining its circular and doubly linked structure.

## Features

- **Double Circular Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, and the list is circular.
- **Node Addition**: Functions to add nodes to the list in a structured manner.

## Files

- `list.h`: Header file containing the structure definition and function prototypes.
- `add_node.c`: Implementation of the function to add nodes to the list.
- `main.c`: Example usage of the double circular linked list.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/holbertonschool-interview.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-interview/double_circular_linked_list
    ```
3. Compile the code:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o add_nodes
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./add_nodes
    ```
